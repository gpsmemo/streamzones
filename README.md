I am a Roku developer and have created both private and puplic Roku Channels since 2011.

The sample listed demonstrates a a working Roku channel I have created. Often the best way to learn a framework is seeing a working application running. Make sure to obtain a Roku device - it's required for following these steps. Products are found at https://www.roku.com/products/compare and on many online stores.

Quick start

Using your Roku remote, enter the following button sequence:

Follow the steps to activate developer mode on your Roku device. Save the IP address at the end of the process (example only: http://20.1.167.275)

Enter the IP address you saved in a web browser, log-in with your username rokudev and the password you set during the developer mode process.

Take  the .zip files and upload/install to the developer application installer. Your Roku device will load the sample channel and you can preview what your Roku Channel will look like when it is installed as a private or public Roku Channel.
